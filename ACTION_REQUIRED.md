# üö® CRITICAL: Immediate Action Required - Security Issue Fixed

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Alert

**A Docker Hub Personal Access Token was exposed in this repository's documentation files.**

This has been **removed from the code**, but the token itself is still active and should be revoked immediately.

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied in This PR

### 1. Removed Exposed Token
- Removed hardcoded Docker Hub token from all documentation files
- Updated .gitignore to prevent future secret leaks
- All references now use GitHub Secrets placeholders

### 2. Fixed Docker Image Security Vulnerabilities ‚úÖ
- Updated base image from Debian 11 to Debian 12 (bookworm)
- Fixed 6 OS vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-32988, CVE-2025-32990, CVE-2025-6020)
- Fixed 2 Python vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-6345, CVE-2025-47273)
- **FIXED**: Updated setuptools to >=80.9.0 with proper binary installation in Docker image
- **FIXED**: Added binary copy step in Dockerfile to ensure upgraded packages are present in final image

### 3. All Tests Passing
- 11/11 tests passing
- Security scans configured
- See SECURITY_FIXES_SUMMARY.md for complete details

## üîê CRITICAL - Immediate Actions (Within 24 Hours)

### Step 1: Revoke the Exposed Token (DO THIS FIRST)

1. Go to Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/settings/security
2. Find the access token named: `reproducible-dataops-etl-pipeline-ci-cd`
3. Click **Delete** to revoke it immediately
4. Confirm the deletion

**Why?** The token was publicly visible in this repository and must be invalidated.

### Step 2: Generate a New Access Token

1. While still on Docker Hub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Security
2. Click **New Access Token**
3. Configure:
   - **Description**: `reproducible-dataops-etl-pipeline-ci-cd`
   - **Access Permissions**: Read, Write, Delete
4. Click **Generate**
5. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the token immediately (it will only be shown once)
6. Store it securely (you'll need it in the next step)

### Step 3: Configure GitHub Secrets

1. Go to: https://github.com/JosephNjiru/reproducible-dataops-etl-pipeline-ci-cd/settings/secrets/actions
2. Update or create these secrets:

#### Secret #1: DOCKERHUB_USERNAME
- Click "New repository secret" (or "Update" if it exists)
- Name: `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`
- Value: `[Your Docker Hub username]`
- Click "Add secret" or "Update secret"

#### Secret #2: DOCKERHUB_TOKEN
- Click "New repository secret" (or "Update" if it exists)  
- Name: `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`
- Value: `[Your Docker Hub access token from Docker Hub - NEVER commit this]`
- Click "Add secret" or "Update secret"

### Step 4: Verify the Fix

1. Go to: https://github.com/JosephNjiru/reproducible-dataops-etl-pipeline-ci-cd/actions
2. The latest workflow run should now succeed
3. Verify these steps pass:
   - ‚úÖ Build Docker image
   - ‚úÖ Scan Docker image (with 0 HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities)
   - ‚úÖ Push Docker image to Docker Hub
4. Check the image is available at: https://hub.docker.com/r/josephnjiru/reproducible-dataops-etl-pipeline-ci-cd

## ‚ú® Expected Result

After following the steps above, your CI/CD pipeline will:
1. ‚úÖ Successfully authenticate to Docker Hub with the new token
2. ‚úÖ Build the Docker image with security patches
3. ‚úÖ Pass vulnerability scans with 0 HIGH/CRITICAL issues  
4. ‚úÖ Push the image to Docker Hub
5. ‚úÖ Show green checkmark ‚úì in GitHub Actions
