# Security Policy

## Dependency Security Status

This project maintains up-to-date dependencies with security patches applied. We use `pip-audit` in our CI/CD pipeline to continuously monitor for vulnerabilities.

### Current Security Posture

✅ **All fixable vulnerabilities have been resolved.**

The following vulnerabilities are temporarily ignored in our CI/CD pipeline with documented justification:

| Vulnerability ID | Package | Current Version | Fix Version | Status | Notes |
|-----------------|---------|-----------------|-------------|--------|-------|
| GHSA-4xh5-x5gv-qwph | pip | 25.2 | 25.3 | 🔶 Pending | Fix planned for pip 25.3 (not yet released). Will update immediately upon release. |
| PYSEC-2024-75 | twisted | 24.3.0 | 24.7.0rc1 | ℹ️ System Package | System-installed package, not used by this project |
| GHSA-c8m8-j448-xjx7 | twisted | 24.3.0 | 24.7.0rc1 | ℹ️ System Package | System-installed package, not used by this project |

### Security Best Practices

1. **Automated Scanning**: Every PR and push triggers `pip-audit` to scan for vulnerabilities
2. **Pinned Dependencies**: We use specific version constraints in `requirements.txt`
3. **Regular Updates**: Dependencies are reviewed and updated regularly
4. **Docker Security**: Multi-stage builds minimize attack surface, non-root user execution
